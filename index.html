          <p class="p">
            I grew up in Calgary, Alberta. With the mountains so near, I fell in love with the outdoors from a young
            age. From skating and snowboarding to hiking, biking, and camping, I tried to spend as much time outside as
            I could. <br /><br />I started playing soccer and badminton very young, and continued until I eventually
            dropped soccer to pursue competitive badminton. I competed in countless local, provincial, and national
            tournaments. Eventually, I acquired my coaching certification. Then, most of my time was spent in school,
            training for badminton, or coaching. My weekends were spent studying or competing in tournaments.<br /><br />Around
            the start of high school, I fell in love with cooking. I enjoyed tasting new foods from different cuisines
            that I cooked myself. I especially enjoyed cooking with fruits and vegetables that I grew or fish I
            caught.<br /><br />In high school I began to realize my passion for technology and problem solving. I
            focused on STEM subjects and eventually decided to pursue engineering. I applied to various schools and
            ended up taking <strong>Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.</strong><br /><br />At university
            I made numerous friends, studied hard, and joined the <strong>varsity badminton team</strong>. Other than engineering, I
            found myself drawn to <strong>entrepreneurship, business, finance, health, and fitness</strong>. I traveled, explored, and
            learned so much. I loved my time there.

            I went to a very small private school just outside of Calgary. I focused on athletics and academics. I
            enjoyed math, physics, computer science, and, of course, physical education. <br /><br />During high school
            I competed in numerous math and computing contests. I received various <strong>awards and recognition</strong> for these
            contests and for my other achievements. Some of these are listed below.<br /><strong>&bull; First Class Honour Roll (grades
            10-12)<br />&bull; 5th in Province - 2017 Newton Contest<br />&bull; 3rd in Province - 2019 Canadian Intermediate

            Elected Schulich Leader</strong><br /><br />After high school, I went to the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> to complete my
          <strong>BASc in Mechatronics Engineering, Co-op</strong>. This program challenged me heavily, and I gained a wealth of
            knowledge throughout my experience. I met some of my closest friends and lost some of the people closest to
            me. I challenged myself to reach my new goals. I learned much more than just engineering at uWaterloo, and I
            am forever grateful for my experience there. I continued focusing on my academics, and I was fortunate to
            receive the following awards.<br /><strong>&bull; Graduating on the Dean’s Honours List<br />&bull; Spring 2023 Term Dean’s
            Honours List<br />&bull; Fall 2024 Term Distinction<br />&bull; Winter 2025 Term Distinction<br />&bull; President’s Scholarship
            2021<br />&bull; James Baleshta Special Merit Award - 2025 Mechatronics Design Symposium</strong><br /><br />In university,
            my studies focused on all the components of Mechatronics Engineering such as <strong>control systems, robotics,
            sensors, embedded systems, and mechanical design</strong>. I did labs and projects focused on <strong>smart technologies,
            automation, and intelligent machines</strong>. In my final years of school, I placed special emphasis on my interests
            which are,<br /><strong>&bull; Control Systems (including multi-variable)<br />&bull; Sensor Fusion<br />&bull; Machine Learning<br />&bull; Wearable
            Systems<br />&bull; System Modeling<br />&bull; Business and Entrepreneurship</strong><br /><br />Some projects and labs that I
            found especially enjoyable and beneficial to my learning are included in my Projects tab.

          <p class="p">
            When I was young, I played soccer and danced. I eventually decided to quit dance and focused more on soccer.
            Around this time, I was also introduced to badminton, which eventually became my biggest passion and focus.
            Our soccer team won multiple city championships and local tournaments, and I even traveled to the US as part
            of a smaller team to compete in a tournament. Although I was quite talented in soccer, I eventually quit to
            focus more on badminton and my academics. I also found enjoyment in other sports such as volleyball,
            basketball, and golf - each of which I played on my high school school teams. I was training for badminton
            many hours each week, and I traveled to compete in tournaments often.<br /><br />In addition to the
            competitive side of sport, I was drawn to its leadership opportunities and sense of community. I acquired my
            coaching certification and began to coach younger players. I also tried to practice leadership through
            displaying sportsmanship as much as possible. Some of the awards I was fortunate enough to receive in high
            school are listed below.<br /><strong>&bull; 2x Alberta Schools Athletic Association (ASAA) provincial champion<br />&bull; ASAA
            Sportsmanship Award<br />&bull; Junior and Senior Athlete of the Year<br />&bull; Representative for Team Alberta at the
            badminton Western Canadian Team Championships<br />&bull; National-level badminton tournament silver medalist</strong><br /><br />In
            university, I continued to play badminton, and was eventually fortunate enough to make the <strong>varsity badminton
            team</strong>. Being a member of this team challenged my work ethic significantly. Balancing academics with varsity
            athletics was difficult, and I often felt overwhelmed. However, I met some of my closest friends, made
            memories I will never forget, and proved to myself that I could accomplish things I previously thought were
            impossible. Getting to be a member of the varsity badminton team is undoubtedly one of the best experiences
            of my entire life. Our team trained almost daily, and I pushed myself very hard to improve. We were a very
            competitive team, and I had some of my best individual accomplishments whilst I was a member. A few of the
            awards that I received during university, as well as some of our team accomplishments, are listed below.<br /><strong>&bull; Gold
            Medalists at the 2024 Canadian National University Championships<br />&bull; Silver Medalists at the 2025 Canadian
            National University Championships<br />&bull; 2x Silver Medalists at the Ontario University Athletics Badminton
            Championships (‘24, ‘25)<br />&bull; Academic Honour Roll for Student Athletes<br />&bull; Most Improved Player - Varsity
            Badminton<br />&bull; Rookie of the Year - Varsity Badminton<br />&bull; 1st at multiple individual local tournaments</strong><br /><br />Currently,
            I continue to play badminton most often. I also enjoy golf, squash, and almost any sport that I get to play.
